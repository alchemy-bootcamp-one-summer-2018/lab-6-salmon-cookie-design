We are a family of four born and raised in Seattle. Our family loves the outdoors and the idea of salmon cookies came to us when we were out camping one day and decided to mix salmon and coffee to the cookie dough that we brought with us and found the final product was scrumptious! Since that day, we decided that we had to share this lovely creation with everyone we knew.
Combining two of our ultimate loves and using the very best resources from the Northwest we have handcrafted a special treat that is both irresistible and healthy! Our <strong> salmon cookies </strong> are made with finely grounded wild caught salmon and locally roasted coffee. Using only organic flour, sugar and eggs we guarantee the freshest and finest ingredients in our cookies. Eat them at tea time or as a power snack, they are great for any time of the day.
Try one and we guarantee you will be back for more!
